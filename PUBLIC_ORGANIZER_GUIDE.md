## How to Check Orders for an Event

- **Go to Orders / Sales:** From the Organizer Dashboard, open the `Orders` or `Sales` section.

- **View Order Details:** Click an order to see purchaser contact info, payment method, individual ticket codes/QRs, and refund status.
- **Manage Refunds/Exchanges:** If supported, use the order detail screen to issue full or partial refunds or exchange tickets according to your policy.
- **Export Orders:** Export filtered orders to CSV for reconciliation or accounting.

Common actions:

## How to View Event Analysis

- **Open Analytics/Reports:** From the Organizer Dashboard, open `Analytics`, `Reports`, or `Event Insights`.
- **Select Event & Timeframe:** Choose the event and timeframe you want to analyze.
- **Key Metrics:** Look for these standard metrics:
  - **Tickets Sold:** Number and percentage of capacity sold.
  - **Gross Revenue:** Total sales before fees and taxes.
  - **Net Revenue:** Earnings after fees, taxes, and refunds.
  - **Average Order Value (AOV):** Revenue divided by number of orders.
  - **Sales Over Time:** A time-series chart showing when sales occurred.
  - **Ticket Type Breakdown:** Sales by ticket category (VIP, General, etc.).
  - **Top Promo/Coupon Performance:** Which coupons drove the most sales.
- **Attendee Demographics (if available):** Age ranges, locations, or segments.
- **Scan/Check-In Data:** If scanning is enabled, view real-time check-ins and no-show rates.
- **Export & Share:** Export charts or CSV reports for stakeholders.

How to use analysis:
- Monitor sales velocity during promotional windows and adjust pricing or marketing.
- Use time-of-day sales trends to plan targeted promotions.

## Troubleshooting & Next Steps

- If you can't see a feature, confirm your account role is `Organizer` and that the event is assigned to your organization.
- For missing orders or payment issues, check the `Payments` section or contact platform support with order IDs.
- Want this as a site page? I can add a route and render this file as a public page in the app.
